# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis

This project analyzes air quality data to study pollution levels, trends over time, and the contribution of different pollutants using basic data analysis techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

Air Quality Index (AQI) is used to indicate how clean or polluted the air is. This project uses real-world data to analyze AQI levels across different locations and time periods in India.

## 🗂️ Data Source

The dataset is collected from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in), which provides open government data related to air quality and pollution levels in India.

## 🛠️ Features

- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- AQI categorization as per CPCB standards  
- Analysis of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, etc.)  
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📈 Output Examples

- Line graph of AQI over months  
- Bar chart comparing cities  
- Heatmap of pollutant correlation  


## ✅ Conclusion

This AQI analysis highlights how pollutant levels vary across time and regions. By examining key pollutants and their impact on air quality, we can better understand environmental conditions and support actions to reduce pollution and protect public health.
